# Ghost Memory System

The **Ghost Memory System** is a modular framework for dynamically adapting neural networks to multiple tasks by injecting task-specific pretrained weights ("ghost memories") into a single base model. This approach allows a model to instantly switch between tasks without retraining, making it efficient and scalable for multi-task scenarios.

## Features
- **Train and Store Task-Specific Weights**: Train models on different tasks and store their weights for later use.
- **Dynamic Weight Injection**: Inject pretrained weights for a specific task into a shared base model.
- **Efficient Task-Switching**: Instantly switch a model's task-specific performance by loading the relevant weights.
- **Lightweight and Modular**: Centralized library for managing and utilizing task-specific weights.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Usage
### 1. Initialize the System
```python
from ghost_memory_system import GhostMemorySystem
system = GhostMemorySystem()
```

### 2. Train Task-Specific Models
Train models on different tasks and store their weights in the library:
```python
system.train_task("Task A", X_train_taskA, y_train_taskA)
system.train_task("Task B", X_train_taskB, y_train_taskB)
system.train_task("Task C", X_train_taskC, y_train_taskC)
```

### 3. Inject Weights and Evaluate
Use a shared base model to switch between tasks dynamically:
```python
model = system.create_model()

# Inject weights for Task A
system.inject_weights(model, "Task A")
accuracy_a = system.evaluate_task(model, X_test_taskA, y_test_taskA)
print(f"Task A Accuracy: {accuracy_a}")

# Inject weights for Task B
system.inject_weights(model, "Task B")
accuracy_b = system.evaluate_task(model, X_test_taskB, y_test_taskB)
print(f"Task B Accuracy: {accuracy_b}")

# Inject weights for Task C
system.inject_weights(model, "Task C")
accuracy_c = system.evaluate_task(model, X_test_taskC, y_test_taskC)
print(f"Task C Accuracy: {accuracy_c}")
```

### 4. List Available Tasks
```python
tasks = system.list_tasks()
print("Available tasks:", tasks)
```

## Example Output
```text
Training model for task: Task A
Task A training complete and weights saved.
...
Injecting weights for task: Task A
Task A Accuracy: 0.96
Injecting weights for task: Task B
Task B Accuracy: 0.99
Injecting weights for task: Task C
Task C Accuracy: 0.98
```

## Applications
- **Dynamic AI Systems**: Quickly adapt models to new tasks in real-time.
- **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Efficiently handle multiple tasks on edge devices.
- **Modular AI Libraries**: Build a library of task-specific pretrained weights for reuse.
